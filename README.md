# Repository Browser

A simple web app to display a GitHub user's public repositories.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.8.

## Getting started

- Requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), developed on version `v14.17.6`.
- Clone repository and run `npm install` in repository root.
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Features

- Display repositories as simple card items
- Change which user's repositories are displayed
- Preview repository's README

The project also includes configations for ESLint and Prettier. The project is structured so further development would be as easy as possible.

## Next steps

As this was a rather small demo project the time used was limited, around 9 hours. Because of this some crucial aspects of the application are missing, such as proper unit testing.
